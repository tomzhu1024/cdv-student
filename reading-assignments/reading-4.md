# Contemporary prediction systems/applications

1. Flight delay estimation system

   The delay estimation system in the airports collects the delay time of previous flights, together with information including the time, the weather conditions, and the air traffic control's (ATC) commands, and uses these information to predict the delay time of upcoming flights. When a flight delay occurs, the system can quickly tell the passengers the estimated time of delayed departure, based on the time, the weather, and the air traffic condition. This system helps the passengers to be better prepared for flight and better manage their time in the airport.

2. Risk assessment system in loans agency

   The risk assessment system gathers previous information about the borrowers, such as his/her age, job, family structure, economic level and his/her repayment behavior. The system will maintain an statistical model which is able to predict the creditworthiness of a customer based on his/her age, job, family condition and economic level, and thus assists the loans agency to determine the amount of loans the customer is able to borrow. The system helps the loans agency to identify potential risky borrowers and minimize the risk of uncollectible loans.

3. Estimation system for courier/takeout delivery time

   The estimation system learns from previous records of delivery time. It fits the data into a model and try to find a relationship between the delivery time and the time of the day, the weather, and the traffic conditions. The system is able to predict when the courier package or the takeout food will be delivered, based on the current situation. The system enables the customers to see the "progress" of delivery in real-time and assists the company to manage their delivery man and increase the efficiency.

# Reflection on "collective average vs. individual fate"

As Hannah Fry agreed in her article, *What statistics can and canâ€™t tell us about ourselves*, the algorithm's prediction can only stand for collective average and is meaningless in terms of individual fate. Taking the risk assessment system in loans agency as an example, it cannot be denied that the system does helps the company to filter potential risky customers and reduce potential loss. However, the system's predictions are true collectively but undetermined individually. There is no guarantee that the system thoroughly considers all factors and never make mistakes. There is probability that the system might mislabels a benign customer as a malicious borrower and fails to detect a customer who cannot repay at all. Predictive systems can only guarantee "averaged correctness", but not "individual correctness". For companies, forecasting systems are always doing the right thing; however, for individuals, forecasting systems can be bad somethings, especially for those who are mislabeled by the system. Just as Virginia Eubanks mentions in *Automating Inequality*, erroneous results of prediction systems can be far-reaching for individuals. In this case, he/she loses the capability to borrow loans; in other cases, he/she might loses the ability to lead a normal life. In a nutshell, the application of predictive systems usually ensures the collective benifits but can harm the individual benifits.
