# Dear Data: Reading Visualization

To me, the *context* of the data includes but not limit to:

- the completeness and randomicity of the dataset
- the subjectivity of people's interpretation to the dataset
- people's purpose to use the dataset

The *context* matters because the results of a big data analysis can be disparate under different *context*. First of all, the dataset might fail to describe the object due to its own limit. For instance, the dataset can be **incomplete**, **pre-filtered**, or **not following a random distribution**. All these circumstances could lead to a biased analytical result. The dataset itself is no more than a collection of data rows. However, the process of analyzing and interpretation is conducted by human beings, who would either intentionally or unintentionally incorporate his/her personal thoughts into the process.

One of my personal experience where the lack of *context* leads to unintended consequences. I used to program a social network spider that can automatically fetch people's posts on QZone (a domestic social network that resembles Facebook). My initial purpose was to analyze people's personalities and relationship network with all their posts and activities on the social networks. Nevertheless, when I saw the results of my program, I found my idea ridiculous and not feasible. What did I notice was that not everyone chooses this particular social network as their primary choice, and people may hide posts that they don't wish me see (my program cannot bypass this visibility permission mechanism). Therefore, the dataset I obtained is incomplete and biased. Also, when it came to me to think about how should I deal with the dataset, I wondered the objectivity. I would process the data in a way I wish. I would interpret the result in a way I prefer. Therefore, the results can only be subjective and not what I though initially, that something objective.

If two authors met with each other, they would quickly and easily reach an agreement on how subjective the current big data and data analytics are. And they would agree with the importance of the *context*. However, perhaps Giorgia Lupi would say more about the complexity and personalization of the data as well as the modern dataviz techniques. :)
