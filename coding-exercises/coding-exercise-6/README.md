## Exercise (coding-exercise-6)

Difficulties encountered and take-away from this exercise:
- Practiced the techniques of handling entering, exiting, and updating data points.
- Practiced the transitions in d3.js.
- Learned how to use delay, duration, and ease to control the transitions and make them consistent. 
- Starting a new transition before the previous transition finished can cause the interruption of the previous transition.
