## Exercise (goat)

In this exercise I encountered
- How to let range input trigger event on every new value
- How to automatically squeeze the width of the child elements in the flex box to fit the parent container

See my work [here](https://tomzhu1024.github.io/cdv-student/coding-exercises/goat/index.html).
